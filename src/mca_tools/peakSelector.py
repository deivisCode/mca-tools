"""
Resets the values of the last peak inserted in the plot. It does so
by removing the elements of the sublist that contains the information
of the last peak.

It doesn't have a input because it's suposed to access a variable in
another scope (outside a function)

peak_positions' structure:
Peak positions is a list that contains lists with another list and a
string. The most nested list contains the start and end poins
of the peak. This is inside another list that contains also a string.
The string is the mode of the peak. If two peaks are too close,
they need to be adjusted together in curve_fit.

The main list contains the tuples for every peak in the graph.

Visual expanation:
[ peak1([start point, end point], "single") peak2([start point 1,
end point 1], "single")]
"""
# The code will be like this:
# list = []
# def func():
#   reset_peak_data(list)
#
# We cannot redefine the list inside the function (list = [],
# so we need to remove all the elements by hand



# Find nearest array element to value

class peakSelector:
    """
    Class for getting the curve_fit parameters of the Gaussian peaks
    in a spectrogram. Is asks for the user to select the peaks to be
    adjusted, by hand. After that, it computes the curve_fit and returns
    the optimal parameters.

    Input:
    file_path: the path to the mca file that contains spectroscopic info

    **kwargs:
        bins_fused: the amount of bins whose data is being "fused" in
                    the rebining. Setting it to 0 or False cancells
                    automatic rebining.

        bkg_file: the path to a mca file containing the data for the
                 background radiation. If specified, the background
                 will be substracted from the main data.

        fig_path: the path where figures will be automatically saved,
                  *relative* to the CWD. MUST end with a "/" (forward slash)
                  Default: "fig_path/"

        fig_ext: the file extension for the figures. Default: pdf

        csv_path: the path where CSVs will be automatically saved,
                  *relative* to the CWD. MUST end with a "/" (forward slash)
                  Default: "fig_path/"

    Methods:
    read_mca: reads the number of counts in each channel and the total
              time of the measurement.

    rebining: joins the data counts of a number of channels to reduce
              uncertainty on the parametric optimization. By default,
              it makes a 10 bin rebining. .rebining takes as an argument
              the number of bins fused.

    plot: represents the data in a static, non-interactive way. It's used
          to test if the data was loaded properly.


    select_peaks: lets the user select the desired peaks to be
                  analyzed by curve_fit. It works with matplotlib
                  spicker events.

    fit_peak: fits the peak to a gaussian function plus a polynomial
              background. In case of having a double peak, it adjusts to
              two gaussian funcions and the polynomial background.
              It accepts all scipy.optimize.curve_fit **kwargs.

              The output is the optimal parameters and the covariance
              matrix.
